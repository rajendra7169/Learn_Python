    Twinkle, twinkle, little star
    How I wonder what you are
    Up above the world so high
    Like a diamond in the sky
    Twinkle, twinkle little star
    How I wonder what you are
    When the blazing sun is gone
    When he nothing shines upon
    Then you show your little light
    Twinkle, twinkle, all the night
    Twinkle, twinkle, little star
    How I wonder what you are
    Then the traveler in the dark"""
