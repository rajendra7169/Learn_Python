# Q-8 If languages of two friends are same; What will happen is problem-7.py?
# Answer: If the langiage of two frineds are same then it will not affect the dictionary. The dictionary will remain same because the keys are unique in the dictionary. The values can be same but the keys should be unique.
# Example: {'Raja': 'Python', 'Milan': 'Python', 'Roshan': 'C++', 'Kusal': 'java'}
# Here, the languages of Raja and Milan are same but the dictionary will remain same.
